My name's Guy. I spend a lot of my time mucking about in the mountains around Cape Town, but when I'm at my desk I like to read and think about mathematics - especially the mathematics behind logic, reasoning and computer science!

Undoubtably one of the great minds of our time, Christopher Hitchens challenged his readers to think deeply on topics of politics, religion, war, and science. This Jekyll theme is designed in his memory.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens):

>Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 â€“ 15 December 2011) was an Anglo-American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic, and journalist. Hitchens was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of over 30 books, including five collections of essays on culture, politics and literature. A staple of public discourse, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded intellectual and a controversial public figure. He contributed to New Statesman, The Nation, The Weekly Standard, The Atlantic, London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, Slate, Free Inquiry and Vanity Fair.
